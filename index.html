    <h2>1.1 Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>How do i get started with PHP?</h3>
    <h4>First way:</h4>
    <li><a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/">XAMPP</a></li>
    <p>XAMPP is an easy way to write php code in an ide and run it in any web browser(Chrome, Firefox, etc.) You can watch a great tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/sWJdeSMDDbQ">here.</a>All you have to do is start an apache and mysql server then go to (localhost/file/fileNameEndingIn.php) then press enter and youre there! Its a little more complicated but that tutorial explains everything!</p>
    <h4>Second way:</h4>
    <li><a href="https://www.replit.com/">Replit</a></li>
    <p>Replit is an online compiler/editor that can be used to program in close to any language, they have so many options such as assemblyx86, C, C++, PHP, python, etc. <br>The list goes on. There are over 200 programming languages to choose from! For programming web applications theres a built in web view where you can view the website in the site.<br>There are many other websites to program PHP but i highly recommend <a href="https://www.replit.com/">Replit</a>.<br><br></p>

    <h2>1.2 Comments</h2>
    <p>Writing comments in php is really easy! all there is to it is for a single line comment, just like most languages its (//) or you can do (#) then the text, for multiple line comments all it is(/*) your multiple line comment text then (*/). Easy as that!</p><br><hr>
    <h2>1.3 Displaying Text</h2>
    <p>There are multiple ways to display text in PHP, the most common way is saying (echo) then the text you want to display in quotes (" "), after that you need a semicolon. <br>Almost all statements in PHP end in a semicolon (;). When you type (echo) it is in not case sensitive so you could also type (Echo), either works! It doesnt matter what type of quote is used (' ') or (" ")<br>Now you can also implement html into strings in an echo statement, for example if i wanted to print a header i can do (echo "< h1 >Text< /h1 >";) and that will print a header.<br>Same goes for (< li > Text < /li >) and (< p > Text < /p >)<br><br></p>

    <h2>1.4 Declaring And Using Variables</h2>
    <p>Just like displaying text, declaring and calling variables are really simple, there are multiple variable types you can store in a variable. For example:</p>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Integer</li>
    <li>Float</li>
    <li>Boolean</li>
    <li>Array</li>
    <li>Object</li>
    <li>NULL</li>
    <li>Resource</li>
    <p>To declare most variables is as simple as saying ($) then the variable name, for example ($name) then what its equal to, ($name = "john";) and they will also always end in a semicolon.<br>This applies for most to all data types, so if i wanted to declare an interger i would do ($age = 35;) and for a boolean i would do ($isAwsome = true;), etc.<br>Now if i wanted to print my variable i would use (echo) then the name of the variable starting with ($), so i can do (echo $name;) and it will print john. <br>I can use concatenation with variables to so if i wanted to print (My name is john)  i can do (echo "My name is ") then a (.) to add something then i can do ($name;) all together its (echo "My name is " . $name;) and the outpu0t of that is (My name is john).<br>If i wanted to print (john is 35 years old) i can do, (echo $name . " is " . $age . " years old";).</p><br>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As you can see PHP is really simple to learn, takes more than a day to get the hang of it, there is so much more you can learn but this is just a source where and can learn a few things to hit the ground running when creating a PHP website.<br>A great resource to learn more about programming in PHP is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp">w3schools.com</a>. <br>Thats all i really have this document may be updated in the future.</p>
